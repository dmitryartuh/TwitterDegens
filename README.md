# Twitter Degens: Tracking and Analyzing Crypto Influencers

## **Idea**

The goal of this project is to monitor and analyze the activity of well-known crypto influencers (often referred to as "degens") on Twitter. By subscribing to their tweets, we can gather data for in-depth analysis, including:

1. **Token Mentions:** Identify all the cryptocurrency tokens they promote or mention in their tweets.
2. **Price Impact Analysis:** Measure the price impact of these tokens after the influencer's posts.
3. **Statistical Insights:** Provide detailed analytics on each influencer's performance, including their reach, engagement, and the success rate of their token picks.

## **How It Works**

1. **Subscribe to Influencers:**
   - Create a list of prominent crypto degens on Twitter.
   - Use Twitter's API or web scraping tools to fetch their tweets in real-time or historically.

2. **Token Extraction:**
   - Analyze the tweets to identify mentions of cryptocurrency tokens (e.g., $BTC, $ETH, or lesser-known altcoins).
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) to filter out irrelevant content and focus on actionable token mentions.

3. **Price Impact Analysis:**
   - Track the price of mentioned tokens before and after the tweet.
   - Calculate metrics such as:
     - Percentage price change (1h, 24h, 7d post-tweet).
     - Trading volume spikes.
     - Market cap changes.

4. **Influencer Statistics:**
   - Build a profile for each degen, including:
     - Average engagement rate (likes, retweets, replies).
     - Success rate of their token picks (e.g., % of tokens that pumped after their tweet).
     - Historical performance of their recommendations.
   - Rank influencers based on their impact and reliability.

## **Potential Use Cases**

- **Investors:** Identify which degens have a proven track record of influencing token prices positively.
- **Traders:** Use real-time alerts to capitalize on price movements triggered by influencer tweets.
- **Researchers:** Study the correlation between social media activity and crypto market behavior.

## **Why This Matters**

Crypto degens on Twitter often have a significant impact on the market, especially for low-cap altcoins. By systematically tracking and analyzing their activity, we can:
- Separate signal from noise.
- Identify trends and opportunities early.
- Avoid falling for pump-and-dump schemes.

This tool could become an essential resource for anyone navigating the volatile and hype-driven world of cryptocurrency.
